Note that this behavior, and the resulting higher average sales by the seller with the larger
capacity, does not rely on advantages the larger sellers may have with respect to customer demand (such
as would exist if, for instance, buyers view largercapacity sellers as more reliable, or think it advantageous to do business with fewer sellers).
As the generalized heterogeneous-cost-and-capacities model shows, the manager of a seller ﬁrm has two
strategic variables with which to play.
Lower costs
of production give inherent beneﬁts to a seller, as
do larger capacities.
Thus, a seller relatively disadvantaged in terms of marginal costs might want to
increase its production capacity.
If the industry is fragmented, with no single overwhelmingly large seller, a
move toward online exchanges by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) might trigger a wave of
consolidation among several sellers, because increasing capacities in this fashion is an easier strategic variable to manipulate, at least in the short run, than lowering marginal costs of production.
In a report on the
automotive industry, McKinsey & Company (2000)
notes that industry has seen a large amount of consolidation among OEMs in recent years, and that this
trend is expected to continue.
It is also conceivable that a seller with superior efﬁciencies of production can, over time, price its competitor out of the market by ratcheting up production
capacity.
Such behavior is seen in real life, though
there are conceivably factors other than increased capacity or cost efﬁciencies at work.
For example, in
the personal computers industry the cost leader, Dell
Computer, has over the years become the largest producer in the world.
In fact, after the second quarter of
2003, it announced that it would reduce the prices of
its computers by an average of around 20%, even as
the nearest competitor, Hewlett-Packard, announced
that its personal computing division is deeply in the

Future Directions of Research
We are currently trying to implement a B2B reverse
auction in a synthetic environment, where semiintelligent sellers learn over time to converge on an
optimum strategy.
Some questions that we hope to
answer include: Can such agents learn over time to
converge to an optimal game-theoretic equilibrium?
If yes, how fast do they converge to that equilibrium?
How does increasing the memory of the past
results increase the speed to convergence toward the
equilibrium?
The results will hold much more interest for the heterogeneous costs and capacities model,
because the artiﬁcial agents are expected to understand over time that (a) it makes no sense to price in
the interval of the two indifference prices, and (b) the
agent with the higher indifference price has a positive
probability of pricing at the reservation price r. We
brieﬂy describe our approach in the next paragraph.
We modeled software agents that use reinforcement
learning (speciﬁcally Q-learning) algorithms (for a
background on the use of reinforcement learning
in game theory, see Oliver (1996), Rapaport et al.
(1998), Roth and Erev (1995), and Sandholm and
Crites (1996) to learn the ideal behavior over time
(the agents start off initially without bias)).
We then
compare the prices chosen for various combinations
of demand, capacities, and marginal costs to the theoretical cumulative distributions for goodness of ﬁt.
Our initial algorithms worked well for similar sellers (see Bandyopadhyay et al. 2003, Bandyopadhyay
et al. 2005), but not for dissimilar sellers.
A modiﬁed
algorithm has given very promising results (for example, the agents quickly learn not to price below the
higher of the indifference prices, and the agent with
the higher indifference price places a positive probability for bidding at r), but we have yet to test it
rigorously for various combinations of Q, K, and c.
We also explore the value of information in this setting: By how much do the average proﬁts go up when
16
The move by Hewlett-Packard to merge with Compaq in 2002
seems to make sense at least from the viewpoint of the analysis
of this paper, because the combined capacities of the two organizations would allow to partially offset the disadvantage of higher
marginal costs.

the agents start with the initial knowledge about the
suboptimality of pricing below the higher indifference
point?
Considering the recent work in understanding game-theoretic behavior in experimental settings,
these experiments with continuous strategy spaces
and complicated equilibrium solutions would be of
considerable interest to researchers and practitioners alike.
Extensions of such research can have useful implications in the implementation of automated
mechanisms by buyers and sellers in transactions of
this kind.
Conclusion
The Internet and the subsequent development of open
standards are making the concept of a buy-centric
online exchange increasingly popular in a variety of
industries.
Sellers of a component or raw material can
be situated anywhere in the world, thus increasing the
universe of sellers from whom an organization can
buy its products.
We have analyzed the competition
between these sellers in an online sealed-bid reverse
auction.
The equilibria for the various models show
the effects of the two strategic variables—cost and
capacity—in a manager’s decision-making model.
The model captures some of the unique features that
we can expect to see in an exchange (limited number
of sellers with huge buying power, modiﬁed capacity constraints, inelastic demand function below reservation price), and shows how competition in those
environments can reduce the overall price paid by the
buyers, as well as how operating costs and capacities
affect the strategies of the competing sellers.
We are currently researching whether synthetic
agents can learn from experience to implement our
results.
With the ubiquity of online transactions, such
automated handling of transactions can potentially be
very beneﬁcial.
