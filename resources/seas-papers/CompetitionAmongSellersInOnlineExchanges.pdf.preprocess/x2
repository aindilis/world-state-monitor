The above distribution for Seller 1 is similar to the
equilibrium distribution characterization in the symmetric case.
However, that is not the case for Seller 2.
Recall that Seller 2 places mass places at r to ensure
that the proﬁts for Seller 1 at r equal those at p2∗ . Noting that 1s p2∗ = p2∗ −c k, we thus have the following
condition:

which determines that 1 − F2 r > 0.

high-cost seller places on the highest price r to ensure
that the low-cost seller achieves proﬁts commensurate
with proﬁts at the lowest price p2∗ given that p2∗ > p1∗ ,

To assume identical proﬁts for the high-cost seller
at all prices in the range p2∗ r , the distribution of
prices for the low-cost Seller 1 must take the form
F1 p =
We thus have two conditions that deﬁne the distribution of prices for Seller 2.
The ﬁrst is derived from
the equal-proﬁt condition for Seller 1 at any p given
the potential for a mass point at r for Seller 2:
r − p2∗ k
2k − Q r − c1
(16)
Given p1∗ = r − c1 Q − k /k + c1 < p2∗ , we can
rearrange this expression to obtain r − p1∗ = r − c1 ·
2k − Q /k . Substituting into the above, we have
F2 r = r − p2∗ / r − p1∗
(17)
It follows that, given p2∗ > p1∗ , it is the case that
F2 r < 1.
Now we can obtain a general expression for the
price distribution of the high-cost seller (Seller 2).
Substituting the expression for F2 r obtained from condition (17) into condition (15) as well as the expressions
for proﬁts when a sale is or is not successful (Equations (6) and (7)), we have

high-capacity Seller 1 must takes the form
(20)
Thus, in summary, if a mixed-strategy equilibrium
exists, the characterization of the distribution functions for the high- and low-cost sellers are given by
Equations (12) and (19), respectively.
We now turn to the case where sellers differ in
capacity rather than in cost.
Heterogeneity in Capacity
Consider the case where c1 = c2 = c but k1 = k2 . Without loss of generality, let k2 = k1 , with < 1, such
that Seller 1 has the larger capacity.
Recall that if the
two sellers have the same cost, then the seller with
the higher capacity will have a lower minimum price,
which means that p1∗ < p2∗ . As before, and arguing similarly, we focus on a mixed-strategy equilibrium, with
each seller’s distribution of prices deﬁned over the
common, continuous range p2∗ r . We obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 5.
If a mixed-strategy equilibrium exists,
the pricing strategy of high-capacity Seller 1 is deﬁned by
a continuous distribution over the range p2∗ r with no
mass at any price.
Low-capacity Seller 2’s pricing strategy
is also deﬁned by a continuous distribution over the range
p2∗ r , but Seller 2 now places a positive mass at the upper
bound of the distribution r .
The above characterization has Seller 1’s pricing
strategy similar to the one obtained for heterogeneous
costs, but now the seller with the larger capacity
behaves similar to the low-cost seller, whereas the
seller with the smaller capacity behaves similar to the
high-cost seller.
We thus have a similar interpretation of this outcome: The low-capacity seller has a
normal price equal to the r, but engages in random
sales.
The high-capacity seller almost always engages
in sales (price below r) and thus is more likely to sell
to capacity.
We now have the following characterization of the
equilibrium price density functions.
As before, if a
mixed-strategy equilibrium exists, it must provide
identical proﬁts for each seller at all prices.
To assume
identical proﬁts for the low-capacity seller at all prices
in the range p2∗ r , the distribution of prices for the

Note that F1 r = 1.
Given p2∗ = r − c Q − k1 /k2 + c,
at F1 p2∗ we have
F1 p2∗ = 1 −
r − c Q − k1 − r − c Q − k1 Q − k1 /k2
r − c Q − k1 /k2 Q − k1 − k2
F1 p2∗ = 0
The above distribution for Seller 1 is similar to the
equilibrium distribution characterization in the symmetric case.
However, that is not the case for Seller 2.
Recall that for Seller 2 it is necessary to place mass
at r to ensure that the proﬁts for Seller 1 at r equal its
proﬁts at p2∗ . Noting that 1s p2∗ = p2∗ − c k1 , we thus
have the following condition:
p2∗ =
1s
1
r
which determines 1 − F2 r > 0.
The mass the lowcapacity seller places on the highest price r to ensure
the high-capacity seller achieves proﬁts commensurate with proﬁts at the lowest price p2∗ given that
p2∗ > p1∗ , implies that s1 p2∗ > s1 p1∗ .
We thus have two conditions that deﬁne the distribution of prices for Seller 2.
The ﬁrst is derived from
the equal-proﬁt condition for Seller 1 at any p given
the potential for a mass point at r for Seller 2:

at r and at the indifference price for Seller 2:

Given p1∗ = r − c Q − k2 /k1 + c < p2∗ , we can
rearrange this expression for p1∗ to obtain r − p1∗ =
r − c k1 + k2 − Q /k1 . Substituting into the above,
we have
F2 r = r − p2∗ / r − p1∗
(25)
It follows that given p2∗ > p1∗ F2 r < 1.
Now we can obtain a general expression for the
price distribution of the high-cost seller (Seller 2).

Proposition 6.
If a mixed-strategy equilibrium exists,
the pricing strategy of the seller with the lower indifference
price (that we call PL ) is deﬁned by a continuous distribution over the range p2∗ r with no mass at any price.
The other seller (or PH ) has a pricing strategy that is also
deﬁned by a continuous distribution over the range p2∗ r ,
but PH now places a positive mass at the upper bound of
the distribution r . In the equations that follow, the subscripts H and L refer to sellers PH and PL , respectively.
We can easily show that

still deﬁne the higher of the indifference prices as
minimum of the support of the strategies of both sellers.
As before, we focus on a mixed-strategy equilibrium, with each seller’s distribution of prices deﬁned
over the common range p2∗ r . We obtain the following proposition.
Heterogeneity in Both Costs and Capacity
Finally, consider the case where c1 = c2 and k1 = k2 , so
the sellers differ in both costs and capacities.
Unlike
the previous two cases, the relative values of the indifference prices depend on both ci and ki , and being
either the low-cost or the high-capacity seller does
not inherently determine the lower of the indifference
prices, although being the lower-cost or the highercapacity seller makes it relatively easier to have a
lower indifference price.
However, note that we can

If a mixed-strategy equilibrium exists, it must provide
identical proﬁts for each seller at all prices charged.
To assume identical proﬁts for PH at all prices in the
range p2∗ r , the distribution of prices for PL must
take the form
FL p =
(28)
Thus, in summary, if a mixed-strategy equilibrium
exists, the characterization of the distribution functions for the high- and low-capacity sellers is given
by (21) and (27), respectively.

Note that FL p∗ = 0, and FL r = 1.
For PH to develop
a best response to the above response of PL , it is necessary to place mass at r to ensure that the proﬁts
of PL at r is equal to the proﬁts at p∗ . With Ls pH∗ =
pH∗ − c kL , we thus have the following condition:
Ls
pH∗ =
L
r
(33)
Equation (33) ensures that PH places mass at r, which
in turn ensures that PL achieves proﬁts commensurate
with proﬁts at the lowest price p2∗ (because pH∗ > pL∗
implies sL pH∗ > sL pL∗ .
We thus have two conditions that deﬁne the distribution of prices for Seller 2.
The ﬁrst is derived from

with the other.
A graphic representation of the two
cumulative distributions is shown in Figure 1.
(35)
which can be inserted in the Equation (34) to get the
complete characterization of FH p .
To summarize, a crucial difference between the previous two cases is that the lowest support price is not
determined solely by the relative costs or capacities,
but is rather a function of the lower of the indifference prices, which is dependent on both the costs and
capacities.
If we substitute the different capacities and
costs with the same costs and capacities for both sellers, the equilibrium reduces to that derived for the
symmetric case.
Generalizing all three cases, we can state that the
lowest support price in the case of asymmetric costs
and capacities of a two-seller model depend on the
relative rankings of the indifference prices.
Both sellers have two strategic variables to consider to establish the lower indifference price (remember that the
seller with the lower indifference price can, probabilistically, set higher prices and get higher payoffs).
Extensions to the n-Seller Case
The analysis becomes more complex for more than
two sellers, but we nevertheless can gain some intuition regarding the effect of an increase in the number
of sellers by analyzing the speciﬁc case of an increase
in market size with the number of sellers increasing,
such that the sellers (a) have the same capacity as
before, (b) remain in the same proportion with respect
to type, and (c) provide the same aggregate excess
capacity, such that there remains a single seller with
the highest price who will sell below capacity by the
same amount as in the smaller market.
If such is the
case, then the bounds for the price distribution and
the accompanying proﬁts at the lowest price (where
capacity is sold with probability one) are unchanged
for each type.
It is now more likely, however, that
a price above this lowest price will not be the highest price at the former distribution of prices.
Thus,
the original distribution of prices will be too high to
ensure identical proﬁts at all prices.
The result will
be a shift downward in the price distribution with an
increase in the number of sellers.
To show this most easily, consider the symmetric
case when costs and capacities are the same across all
sellers.
With n sellers, n − 1 sellers supply to capac-

ity and the last seller supplies to the residual demand
nK − Q > 0 . A seller now fails if his price turns out
to be the highest price among all the sellers (an event
that happens with a probability of F p n−1 and succeeds otherwise (an event that occurs with a probability of 1 − F p n−1 . Using similar arguments as
before, we have the expected proﬁts given by

n−1

n−1
(36)
which implies a price distribution Fn p for the symmetric n-seller case as
Fn p =
−
s−
1/ n−1
s
f
(37)
In (37), we introduce the subscript n to differentiate
the number of sellers for the particular price distribution under consideration.
It is important to note that
to have a valid comparison across markets of different
numbers of sellers, we specify that s p and f p
are invariant to changes in the number of sellers.
The
support of the price distribution remains unchanged
as well.
From Equation (37), given s > > f , it
follows that
Fn p > Fn−j p
(38)
(that is, Fn−j p stochastically dominates Fn p ) for all p,
with n > 2 and n − 1 > j > 1.
The implication is that
as n goes up, the distribution shifts mass to the lower
prices, and the average price falls.
Whether this result
holds in more general settings with more than one
type of sellers or with disproportionate changes in the
types of sellers remains an open question.
Managerial Insights
The inherent attraction of B2B marketplaces lies in
their promise of bringing efﬁciency to the supply
chain.
Buyers can get better prices from sellers from
the effects of increased liquidity, and therefore from
the increased competition among sellers.
Our paper
analyzes this competition, keeping in mind seller
heterogeneity.
The competitive status of a seller, and in particular the advantages to cost cutting or capacity growth,
can be clearly identiﬁed from our analysis.
The equilibrium result of the two-seller heterogeneous costs
57
model is as expected—the lower-cost producer has
an inherent advantage in its pricing strategies.
What
is more interesting is the result of the heterogeneouscapacities model, where the results support the notion
of bigger is better.
This result ﬂows directly from
the fact that the high-capacity seller has a lower
indifference price; to compensate for that fact, the
low-capacity seller must allow a higher proﬁt to the
high-capacity seller in equilibrium at all prices in
the support.
