Agent based modeling enables investigators and policy
makers to model complex, adaptive social systems and their
Health Care Manage Sci (2007) 10:331–339
associated policy problems even when data are limited.
These social systems present nonlinear sources of uncertainty that can be modeled by interacting adaptive agents
[35].
The present model is largely based on literature
regarding well-being.
Currently research is ongoing into
social science theories that shed light on information
diffusion through social networks of actors, public opinion
formation, institutional behavior and decision making [36,
37].
A great deal more research and modeling is needed to
better understand the dynamics of these processes, especially in refugee communities.
The work presented here is
an initial attempt to model these processes and their effects
on health and well-being of refugees.
Much more extensive work is needed to validate the
model.
One possibility would be to determine if the present
model captures the qualitative histories of existing refugee
camps in Darfur; Palestinian camps such as Ain al-Hilweh;
and other camps in Ethiopia, Sudan, the Ivory Coast and
Afghanistan.
5 Conclusions
Policy simulations are valuable because of their ability to
facilitate training and feedback concerning potential impact
of decisions.
In the real world, policy decisions may have
serious consequences.
Policy simulation models are useful
because they accelerate creation of scenarios, allow rapid
changes in parameters, and provide a test bed for concepts
and strategies.
In the present application, policies can be
examined to see how refugee communities might respond
to alternative courses of action and how these actions are
likely to affect the health and well-being of the community.
For example, the model could be used to address some of
the following questions:
1.
How do different mixes of income level, basic needs,
religion education and ethnicity affect the health and
well-being of refugees?
2.
What are the dynamics among international and
national organizations that provide optimal health care
and relief for refugees?
For example, should refugees
be allowed to work and contribute to the local
economy?
Should relief programs be designed to
strengthen existing local welfare efforts rather than
remaining independent of these efforts [5].
3.
What are the optimal policies for refugee camps in
terms of provision of food and water, sanitation,
security, medical personnel and medical resources in
order to make maximum use of international aid funds?
4.
What is the impact of shocks on the refugee camp
model: for example, forcing refugees prematurely to
Health Care Manage Sci (2007) 10:331–339
return home, interruptions to the supply of food and
water, limited medical resources, etc., and attacks by
militia on refugees?
In the future, the agent types included in this model will
be expanded and the Refugee Camp Agent will operate
inside an even more agent-rich environment.
Also, because
simulation data can be generated so quickly, larger
experimental designs will be conducted across a longer
time span.
Our model can easily be adapted to represent the
conditions that exist immediately after natural disasters
such as hurricane Katrina, the Indonesian tsunami, and
recent earthquakes.
In these situations, large populations
become immediately displaced and require basic housing,
sustenance, and medical care.
In some areas, security may
be an important issue as well.
The model presented here can
be used to represent these types of situations and explore
potential policy decisions.
