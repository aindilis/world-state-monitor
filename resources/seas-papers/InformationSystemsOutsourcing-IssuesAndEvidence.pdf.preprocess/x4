M.What to outsource?
There are many questions
commonly
asked by managers
considering
outsourcing,
these include: What to outsource?
Shall firms outsource
complete IS function?
Is it better to outsource only certain IS activities?
Does this depend
on the nature
of business
of the firm?
The IS
development
effort and the role of incomplete
contracts and outsourcing in that context has been analysed by Richmond
et al. l3 Incomplete
contract framework
is used as most outsourcing
contracts are incomplete, since rapidly changing technology
and organizational
environment makes it impossible to specify every contingency
in a contract.
For
example, the IBM-Kodak
contract requires IBM to maintain a ‘state-ofthe-art’ data centre during the course of the contract.
It does not state in
specific terms what operating system version, disk technology,
etc. shall
be used.
The results of the model, under certain assumptions,
indicate
that value generated
from outsourcing
and development
effort comes
from the specific investments
made by the vendor,
and outsourcing
dominates internal development
when this investment
is relatively more
important
than investments
by the internal user group.
This provides
one economic explanation
for the coexistence of both internal development teams and of various outsourcing
services.
Does it mean that it is
better to outsource
routine application
systems’ development,
while
retaining the more involved, business-related
applications
in-house?
Various other articles make general comments about retaining the IS
functions
which are ‘strategic’, while outsourcing
the operational
systems.
What are the contractual issues?

Outsourcing
and contracting
issues
in the systems
development
life cycle.
Working paper, William E. Simon Graduate School of Business
Administration,
University of Rochester,
NY.
At the heart of outsourcing
is the contract which guides the activities of
the parties involved and is the source for any conflict resolution.
A
game-theoretic
model to incorporate
incentive
and information
issues
associated with contracting
for software development
is developed
by
Whang.i4
Under certain assumptions,
the model constructs
a viable
contract
that aligns the incentives
of the contracting
parties
and
produces the same equilibrium
as for in-house development.
The paper
states that the derived contract is mathematically
neat, but has limited
applicability
because of difficulty in obtaining,
or agreeing on, the input
parameters.
Contractual
issues pertaining
to the various stages of the systems
development
life cycle (SDLC) are identified
and examined
by Richmond and Seidman.”

authors have shown that for new customized software development,
with the possible exception of the procedure development phase, all
other phases are amenable to outsourcing.
Mapping of other phases to
different governance structures (market, trilateral and bilateral) is
proposed.
Ketler and Walstromi6 present some pertinent issues in
vendor contracts
which are grouped as experience,
planning,
technology/personnel,
contract issues, communication, transfer of personnel and financial stability (Table 4).
Such analytical work needs to be followed up by empirical research to
show the validity of the results and the assumptions in real situations.
Empirical evidence for the outsourcing phenomenon is needed, especially: is it really happening across the spectrum of industries?
Is it part
of a larger phenomenon whereby the very nature of the firm is
changing?
The potential of IS outsourcing resulting in the adoption of a new
organizational form is explored by M~Lellan.
l7 This new organizational
form, known as the ‘dynamic network’, may come as a result of
large-scale vertical disaggregation, internal and external brokering,
full-disclosure information systems and market substitutes for administrative mechanisms.

The above is not an exhaustive list of issues related to IS outsourcing.
Many other issues, such as implications for IS professionals,i’ end-user
computing support etc., are being explored too.
Content analysis of references to outsourcing in annual
reports
Clients’ annual reports
Content analysis” for information sy stems reseach has been successfully
used by Jarvenpaa and Tves2i and Neo.** The first addresses the
relationship between information
technology (IT) and corporate
strategy.
The second deals with IT and the firm’s competitive advantage.
Here, we will use content analysis to identify the value of the
outsourcing activity for the 62 companies listed in Table 3.
For this
International Journal of Information Management 1994 Volume 14 Number 4
IS outsourcing:
issues and evidence: K Altinkemer,
A Chaturvedi and R
Gulati
purpose the annual reports, where the companies explain outsourcing
activities, are examined.
Table 5 shows whether a company’s annual
report refers to the outsourcing activity in the year of the major
outsourcing contract.
For the 16 companies who signed an outsourcing
contract in 1993, their annual reports are not yet available.
From the
rest, we collected annual reports for 25 companies.
Of these, nine did
not refer to the outsourcing activity to the shareholders.
The other 16
mention outsourcing issues in their annual reports.
Hook SupeRx
outsourced in 1993 but they mentioned the benefits in their 1992 annual
report.
It appears that high technology and information intensive
companies tend to announce outsourcing activities in their annual
report.
Twelve of the companies are international companies and only
Saab Scania AB’s annual report is available.
The reasons why companies opt for outsourcing as mentioned in the
annual reports are given in Tables 6 and 7.
The most cited reason is cost
reduction.
Eleven of the 17 companies believe that specialized IS
companies can do IS activities cheaper.
In addition, one company also
mentioned transforming fixed costs into variable costs as the reason for
outsourcing.
The second most mentioned reason is the desire to be at the forefront
of technology.
Outsourcing activity is believed to bring the recent
technological advances to company’s fingertips.
Nine companies think
along these lines.
One additional company believes that they can get
unlimited capacity which could be translated as the forefront of technology.
Another company talks about technological integration which can
be looked under the same umbrella.
Seven companies point out that outsourcing brings efficiency.
Four of
them also mention cost reduction.
It is interesting that they talk about
efficiency which shows that they expect outsourcing to reduce the cost as
well as increase the value.
Other mentioned characteristics are flexibility, strategic alliance and
better focus on company’s core business.
Long-term contract, access to
companies’ secret information and dependence on each other build a
deeper relationship between the company and the vendor.
One’s
success affects the others.
One’s performance depends on the others.
The price the vendor charges is a function of the satisfaction level of the
existing customers over a period of time.
The strategic alliance is
achieved by letting the company do its own business and allowing the
vendor to perform information services.
This is accomplished through a
calculated risk in mutual trust and respect.
It is interesting that flexibility is mentioned as a plus in some annual
reports.
However, the outsourcing literature contends outsourcing
reduces flexibility, because long-term outsourcing contract binds a
company in a partnership with the vendor that is difficult to break, thus
limiting flexibility.
On the other hand one can easily change the
computational capacity or a selection of software, which translates into
increased flexibility.
We will close this discussion by saying flexibility is
a function of the contract, an honour system between the vendor and
the company and the damage that the company can do to the vendor’s
reputation.
Deeper research is needed to determine the true effect of
outsourcing on flexibility.
