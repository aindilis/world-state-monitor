IS outsourcing: issues and evidence: K Altinkemer,
A Chaturvedi and R Gulati
forecast that IS outsourcing
expenditures
will be between $15 to $50
billion in 1995 and there are examples
in the retail industry
and
commercial
banking industry to support the claims.
Table 3 lists the
major outsourcing
contracts.
One study shows statistically
significant
excess returns
in stock prices on the announcement
days for the
companies
that decided to outsource.
Other studies indicate what to
outsource,
how to outsource and under what conditions
to outsource.
The content analysis of annual reports has been explained to find the
value of outsourcing
contracts.
The number one reason is cost reduction.
The number
two reason given is to be at the forefront
of
technology.
It is important
to note that two of the conceptual
advantages to outsourcing,
strategic alliance and better focus on company’s
core business,
are sure to become more important
as outsourcing
becomes more common.
The relationship
between performance
such as
revenue per employee and sales per employee and outsourcing
has been
shown, however, the number of data points are too few to reach a solid
conclusion.
Some outsourcing
contracts are not disclosed to the press.
It is very
difficult to estimate the exact amount spent on IS outsourcing.
Concrete
proof is needed that companies
are really spending more money on IS
outsourcing.
This is very difficult, since some studies show the amount
spent in 1990 as $30 billion while others declare it to be $7 billion.
One extension
of this research is to study the concrete proof of IS
outsourcing
expenditures.
One option is to do a time series analysis of
outsourcing
expenditures.
The other option is to analyse the revenues of
outsourcing
vendors.
Both of these options are difficult, since the data is
hard to collect.
Also, vendors
like IBM have other facets of their
business,
therefore,
it is very difficult to divide the total revenue by
certain functions.
Other interesting
research questions include: Where are we heading?
Is this growing trend unique to IS or does it involve other functional
areas as well or is it a US or global phenomenon?
Are we reliving ‘the
hollowed out corporation?’
In other words, ‘are companies
becoming
virtual?’
