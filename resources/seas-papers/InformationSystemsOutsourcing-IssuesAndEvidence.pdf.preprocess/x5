that most of them either do not mention the outsourcing contract or
discontinue mentioning it after the first year of the contract.
Among the
six companies that do mention outsourcing in the annual reports, they
agree on the effects of outsourcing.
Companies (Tables 8 and 9) believe
that outsourcing reduces the cost for the outsourcing company, brings
better services and technology and allows the company to focus on their
core business activity.
In its first annual report since the outsourcing
contract, EDS mentioned outsourcing as effective, which in the later
year was quantified as the three characteristics mentioned above.
Businesses who opted for outsourcing, believe that specialized IS
companies can bring ‘state-of-the-art’ IS services at a cheaper cost than
they can have in house (Table 10).
For example, in its contract with
IBM, Kodak requires IBM to provide ‘state-of-the-art’ equipment at all
times.
In an interview, Katherine Hudson, Kodak’s Vice-President and
General Manager of the Imaging Group, who was responsible for the
outsourcing move, emphasized that the key to the outsourcing success
was the ‘chemistry’ between IBM and Kodak, and their mutual belief in
the honour system.
Kodak is proud of this achievement and is currently
having people visit their ‘state-of-the-art’ data centre which is a form of

voluntary
advertisement
for outsourcing
and IBM.
It should be noted,
however, that this tie is enforced by the implicit penalty function, which
may involve informing
the stock market if IBM defaults.
This would
cost IBM dearly in terms of the current market value and future lost
customers.
The honour system enforced by the implicit penalty function
leaves little room for post opportunistic
behaviour
by IBM.
The
prohibitive
change over cost for Kodak, forces both the parties to
guarantee
the success of the partnership.
Another
interesting
question
is whether outsourcing
is an international phenomenon.
We could only obtain information
on 12 international companies,
one multinational
deal and only one annual report
was accessible.
Most of the international
outsourcing
occurred in 1993.
The number
of outsourcing
deals are becoming
widespread
internationally.
However,
there are not enough annual reports to conclude
whether international
organizations
value outsourcing
the same way
most US organizations
do.
Hence it is an open research issue whether
the US findings can be generalized
to the international
context.
Outsourcing
can be used as a strategic weapon for staying even or
gaining
competitive
advantage.2”
It might not be right for every
situation.
US managers might be giving up more than they anticipated.
This requires the US managers to be more careful with the outsourcing
decision.
They need to look at the international
arena and better ways
of costing information.
The quality of information
the managers
are
using to make decisions
are associated
with risk.24 In addition
to
regulatory
and technological
risks, there are especially significant risks
associated
with using old accounting
systems to make international
decisions.
The following are some examples of international
deals.
Infonet Services Corp., AT&T and BT/Syncordia

Telekom,

Mexico’s Ministry
of Finance had a deal with SHL Systemhouse
Inc. and Canada Post for
data processing,
telecommunication
and system management
worth
$550 million in 1992.29 At present, the international
outsourcing

international
telecommunications.
The above discussion
leads into the more fundamental
and philosophical question, whether outsourcing
is specific to IS functions or is it
as widespread
as publicized.
Although it is very hard to collect data and
show trends,
we would point readers to the one-person
company
portrayed
in Harvard Business School case R&R (9-386-019).
In this
case Bob Reis outsources
all functions which includes design, marketing, sales and others and exists as a one-person
company.
This research
can be extended
to enlarge the scope and consider whether the basic

organizational
form is evolving towards a ‘virtual’ organization
(concept
similar to the ‘strategic network’ of Miles and Snow30 or ‘hollowed out’
corporation);
or perhaps
we can hypothesize
that, with vanishing
barriers of time and space, society is moving almost completely towards
‘electronic markets’.

Another
interesting
question
is whether
there is any relationship
between IS outsourcing
and the firm’s performance.
One can study the
research
on impact of information
technology
(IT) on the firm’s
performance
to analyse the effect of outsourcing
on the firm’s performance.
In a recent study, 31 the authors found that IT investment
variables
became significant predicators
of performance
when they are grouped
together
and analysed.
One of the performance
variables
used by
Mahmood
and Gary”2 is sales per employee.
It is proved to be
significantly
related to IT investment
variables.
Most studies caution against the use of a single measure of performance.
Many confounding
variables exist and in order to glean the effect
of IT or any other phenomenon
on performance,
there is a need for a
conceptual
model.
Also, there is a need for longitudinal
and crosssectional data.
For example, in the banking industry one may need to
collect data on organizational
performance
with and without outsourcing, nature of outsourcing
contracts, and other organizational
variables.
Smith and McKeen’3 suggest that business revenue per capita is a good
measure for the firm’s performance.
There is a general agreement
among managers that the effectiveness
of outsourcing
contracts can be measured by the value added benefit to
each employee.
However, the main problem of this measure is that no
one has either defined or collected data on this important
yardstick.
This leaves us with no choice but to use the sales per employee measure.
Tables 11 and 12 show apparent values for non-banking
and banking
companies
who are involved with outsourcing.
For the non-banking
companies
the value is given in terms of sales per employee.
In most
cases, sales per employee figures increased in the year outsourcing
was
announced.
However,
there are cases where sales per employee
decreased after and in the year of outsourcing.
In five cases, sales per
employee jumped during the year of outsourcing.
There are two cases
where this productivity
measure decreased in the year of outsourcing.
For the banking
companies,
deposit market share is used as the
dependent
variable
in Banker
and Kaufmann’s
study.
Some other
studies considered total assets per employee as a criterion.
In Table 12,
revenue per employee
is used as a variable to measure the effect of
outsourcing.
As is evident from Table 12 this variable does not show a
general pattern.
It is very difficult to reach a conclusion
without a
conceptual
model.
