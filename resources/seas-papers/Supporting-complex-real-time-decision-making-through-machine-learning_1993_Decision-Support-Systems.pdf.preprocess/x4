ing it easier to understand working relationships
in the dynamic system.
FMS-DSS is not without
its disadvantages.
As in the case of any inductive
learning system, FMS-DSS may be prone to improper generalizations in the face extremely imprecise situations.
The knowledge acquired by the
system is dependent on the set of training data
employed-clearly, poor examples will engender
substandard domain knowledge.
When presented
with a situation with radically different assumptions than those encountered before, FMS-DSS's
performance may be questionable.
Lastly, in its
current implementation in a LmP environment,
FMS-DSS is a resource-intensive system.

Conclusions
This paper enumerates some problems with
current approaches to decision making for realtime systems and discusses the need for new
methods.
It then presents FMS-DSS, a decision
support system based on goal-directed conceptual
aggregation for supporting FMS scheduling and
control decisions.
Conceptual aggregation is an
AI approach which applies a modified conceptual
clustering technique and case-based learning for
explaining and summarizing data.
It also has the
capability of dealing with the imperfections of
data such as inconsistency, contradiction, and incompleteness.
Results show that upon integration
with machine learning, DSS can become a powerful tool for supporting, and perhaps making,
real-time decisions.
