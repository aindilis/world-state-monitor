Krannert Graduate School of Management and the Department of Computer 
Sciences (courtesy) and the Founder, Chairman, and the CEO of Simulex 
Inc., a Modeling and Simulation Company located in Purdue Technology 
Park. He is the technical lead for US Department of Defense’s Sentient 
World Simulation project. Dr. Chaturvedi is the founding Director of 
Purdue Homeland Security Institute and has also served as an Adjunct 
Research Staff Member at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), 
Alexandria, Virginia – a leading think tank on national and homeland 
securities matters.</p>
<p>He received his Ph.D. in Management Information Systems and Computer 
Science from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He is an 
accomplished scholar and thinker and has published extensively in major 
journals and conference proceedings. Dr. Chaturvedi has been working on 
multi-agent synthetic environments for over fifteen years. He has led a 
team of researchers to develop the Synthetic Environment for Analysis 
and Simulation (SEAS). SEAS is extensively being used by the US 
Department of Defense for war games, experimentations, planning, 
analysis, operations, and shaping in multiple theaters. National 
Training Simulations Association (NTSA) recognized SEAS as the best 
simulation for analysis in all of Department of Defense for the year 
2005. Dr. Chaturvedi is the Principal Investigator (PI) and the Project 
Director for several major grants from National Science Foundation, 
Indiana 21st Century Research and Technology Fund, Office of Naval 
Research, Defense Acquisition University, and several Fortune 500 
companies. He has been involved with several Government task forces on 
important public policy and national security matters. Professor 
Chaturvedi was named in Federal 100 by Federal Computer Weekly and was 
awarded the “Sagamore of the Wabash” by the Governor of Indiana, the 
highest civilian award for his service to the State.</p><br></td><td width="20px"></td></tr>
