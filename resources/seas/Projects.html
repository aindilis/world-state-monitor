<p> Measured Response is a simmulation event that creates the 
opportunity for first responders, government agencies, industry 
and citizens to come together and create awareness about and respond to a
 simulated, high-consequence crisis situation. The goal 
is to create awareness and inform the community of the risks and 
responses to terrorist attacks, as well as to deveelop and analyze 
policies and operating procedures to manage public mood, maintain public
 health, mitigate the risk of contagion, and contain the crisis. 
Another goal is to create a virtual test-bed to plan various response 
and recovery strategies by the industry and the government.</p>
<p>Measured Response is a two day simulation event that brought together
 participants from all over the country. Participants ranged 
from Federal, State and Local departments of the government, with 
representation from but not limited to the Department of Homeland 
Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the 
Department of Transportation. Members of the community as well as 
industry 
are invited to participate in the exercise along with first responders 
like the police, fire and health personnel.</p></td>

<p>Air Traffic Management &amp; Control is a complex problem and in 
day-today operations needs a human in loop to resolve various routine and emergency scenarios. 
This project created a Simulated Air Traffic control using a system-of-systems approach. 
The ultimate objective being to simulate various emergency scenarios as part of homeland 
security initiative, and also to simulate an environment where manned and unmanned air 
vehicles travel through the national airspace with minimum inputs from ATC and maximum 
information.</p></td>

<p>A Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS) was created to study
 interaction between fire and agent models during a fire 
evacuation. The analysis from that research can be used to validate 
proposed ideas in evacuation and building designs to ensure 
safety of buildings given various agent behaviors. Two separate models 
were used to simulate the components of the emergency situation: 
fire and agent. The independent models w
ere able to run using data computed by the other interacting models, 
allowing careful examination 
of real-time interactions in a situation. Through study of the 
interactions, a better understanding is gained of how individual 
variables 
such as exit position and width affect the evacuation process and escape
 rate in the given scenario. Exits can be relocated and changed to 
quickly assess the effect on the model. The results can be used for 
improving building design and regulations as well as training first 
responders.</p></td>

<p>The Food Defense Simulation modeled the food supply chain from processors to distributors and retail stores. 
A contaminant was then introduced somewhere in the supply chain, and participants were given a chance to react to the 
ensuing situation and see how their decisions effected the scenario, as well as public opinion of their products.  </p></td>

<p>Federal, state and local first responders gathered at the Muscatatuck 
Urban Training Center for a live training exercise called Operation SINBAD in December 2005. About 25 local agencies 
from various different counties, from police, fire and health agencies, along with several hospitals and universities, 
participated in the two day live exercise event sponsored by the Indiana DHS.</p>
<p>The simulation provided a way to model a much larger geographic area,
 as well as a larger population, to provide more 
detailed analysis of the impact of the bioterrorist attack. While first 
responders were at the scene enacting their response 
to the bioterrorist attack, the simulation was capturing all the 
decisions being made. Decisions such as actions taken, resources 
allocated and time needed to complete such actions were taken into 
account and recorded. These decisions would impact the public 
health statistics of virtual Indiana, along with a measure of the 
economic impact and public approval rating.</p>
<p>The goal of the exercise was to allow multiple agencies to address any issues that may arise when responding to the 
scenario. Inter-agency communication and coordination were the two obvious hurdles any agency had to deal with, along with 
resource allocation and management. The live exercise included testing lab protocols, mass immunization plans and the use of 
the CDC national stockpile. </p></td>
