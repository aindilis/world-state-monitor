WSM

World State Monitor

Responsible for tracking and syncing real-world state in order to plan


WSM is similar to the Sentient World Simulation.  It is responsible
for establishing models of the real world based on evidence it comes
across.  For instance, a temporal semantics has been implemented based
on recording observations of the real world, and knowing the last
known state for a particular relation or predicate.  Eventually, would
like to track confidence, and learn how quickly uncertainty usually
grows regarding specific facts, and try to infer when circumstances
dictate that a particular fact is likely to have changed.  This will
integrate with sensors such as basic ones all the way to video object
recognition and resolution.
