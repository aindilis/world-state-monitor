(Possible lies consistute part of the problem)

(Do the quick and dirty creation of the temporal relations for
 the world state monitor.

(World State Monitor should pay attention to Cyc's
 #$subSituations, #$Situation, #$CausationPredicate(s), #$PossibleHistory)

(world-state-manager is similar to problemspace)

(these are important for some reason I'm forgetting - maybe with
 world-state-monitor/comparison/suppositional-reasoner etc:
 /var/lib/myfrdcsa/codebases/minor/agent/to.do)

(use for story understanding, use story-understanding for it)
(have it update times, have it game)
(have a prolog transitive predicate to represent location plus
 containers, so a default location predicate for an object is
 also the room that the box that contains the object.)
(query about whether items are in their default locations, when they were last seen)
(incorporate default locations of objects)




(should naturally be able to work with different hypothetical
 versions of the world, popping stack and such.  seems to
 naturally be related to the suppositional-reasoner.)

(responsible for tracking the state of the world, tagging updates
 with information on recency, conducting inquiries as to relevant
 world state changes, infering changes from other facts, etc)
