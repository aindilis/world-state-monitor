(Get the items from that list into the system, so that it knows
 about them, and that we can keep them up to date for planning
 purposes.)

(try to get an MVP going Minimum Viable Product for WSM, so it
 actually can track the state of certain objects)

(have the ability to submit to the WSM that you saw something in
 a certain place)

(have the ability to jump to a certain contingency or world)

(look into relation to modal logic)
(look into GDL-II for insight into how this could work)
(integrate GAMER anyway as a sequential planner)

(Query the DB for information about things relevant to the plan that
may have moved since they haven't been observed for a while.)

(Apply learning to figure out which items get moved more often.)

(Record sitings and such in a log.  Rebuild from the log.  Have an
 instantaneous state.)



(implement the Cyc interface which does all the type checking and
 such)

(object recognition results)
(integrate IAEC here for tracking the details and groking the
 semantics of the relatinoships observed)
(Integrate manager and event-log as needed.)



(Need to codify using Cyc, and then save using Formalog)

(Have a truncateFromDate which takes a date and truncates the
 context so that KB starts from that date from now on)
